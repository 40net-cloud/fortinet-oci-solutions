**Official Note**: After deployment, FortiGate-VM instances may not get the proper configurations during the initial bootstrap configuration. User may need to do a manual factoryreset on the FortiGate-VMs in order to get proper configurations. To do factoryreset in FortiGate, user can login to the units via Console, and execute following command:

```
exec factoryreset
```
## Deployment

Following links are prepared to deploy FortiGate A/P cluster in Dual-AD in a specific region. You can select required FortiOS version to proceed. Since buttons will be re-directing to use OCI Stacks service, user should be already logged into OCI Dashboard.
